# SC1015 Mini Project - Group K
Mini Project For NTU SC1015 PT Group K

## Introduction

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015  which focuses on how personal habits might affect the risk of having an Heart disease. The Mini-Project Notebook contanins the following information:

1. [DataSet Cleaning]
2. [DataSet variable Analyse]
3. [Relationship between the Response variable and Predictor variable]
4. [Decision Tree Draft]
5. [Decision Tree optimized]

## Problem Definition

- How does the different variables which shows individuals personal habits affect the result of Heart Disease in the dataset. 
- To Create a optimised Decision Tree that best identify the risk of a personal having Heart disease based on personal habits.


## Method Used

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. GridSearchCV


## Conclusion

- Resampling imbalanced data improved model performance especially on the minority class
- Combining the method of Random Forest and GridSearchCV by using GridSearchCV to determine the optimal hyper-parameters to maximize accuracy of the classifier.
- This optimised Decision Tree can best identify the risk of a personal having heart disease based on personal habits. 
- Individuals or healthcare workers may use this model to check the risk of a person having heart disease.


## What did we learn from this project?

- Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods
- Encoding the categorical variables
- Combining the method of Random Forest and GridSearchCV
- Collaborating using GitHub
